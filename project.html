                    <p>It is a basic personal portfolio prototype that I created to present myself as a student designer and developer. It displays such details as my name, picture, contact details, social media links, and a hire me button. The basic aim of this prototype is to introduce who I am, what I do, and provide a basic overview of what I can do and what I have done in a simple attractive manner.</p>

                    <p>It is a prototype of an online shoe store known as Kaka store. It shows various pairs of shoes with the prices and add to cart buttons, as well as filter by brand and gender. The prototype is designed as a demonstration of the design concept and layout of an e-commerce website and how the user can navigate through products in the most convenient manner. It is not a full-scale system but just a design prototype.</p>
